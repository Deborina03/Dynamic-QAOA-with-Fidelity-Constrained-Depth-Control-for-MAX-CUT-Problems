# Dynamic-QAOA-with-Fidelity-Constrained-Depth-Control-for-MAX-CUT-Problems
Implemented a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) simulator in Qiskit for solving MAX-CUT on graph-based problems that dynamically adjusts circuit depth by tracking quantum fidelity and entanglement entropy, ensuring resource efficiency.
